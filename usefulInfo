package file:
    *It is important json file, this contains the list of dependencies which are required to execute the application
    *it stores only the dependency details instead of folders. Bez folders consumes lot of memory when we store into git repo
    *It is added automatically by executing "npm init -y" on the root folder.

.env file:
    *It stores all the senstivie and not sharable data/info like DB credentials, port no, API Keys, etc..
    *We should not copy this file into PROD or git repository. Use .gitIgnore to prevent from copying into repository

config folder:
    * It contains js files which are maintaining the all configuration details like DataBase config (sername, DBname, username, etc), server related config details

Node_modules:
    This folder is big in size. generally not preferred to commit into git. bez it will be reproduced thru package.json while executing the project thru npm init -y

Project Structure folders explanation:
    *View/Front end folder - It View contains all frontend files (react, html, etc..)
    *src folder:
        -middleware folder: Contains Files which are related to any authentications and validations. Seperate directory kept away from controller folder, so it is improving security.
        -models folder: Contain the details about the object which are used between Database and the controller. Example: User object- UserName, emailId, mobile, etc..
        -routers folder: Contains files which are responsible to pass the request to controller
        -Services folder:has Files with actual business logic used to access the database


Deployment:
    * Keep seperate folders for front end & back end coding. Backend code should be more secured
